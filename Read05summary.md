In this section, we will look at how to make your web pages more attractive, controlling the design of them using CSS.
CSS allows you to create rules that specify how the content of an element should appear.The key to understanding how CSS
works is to imagine that there is an invisible box around every HTML element.The <link> element can be used in an HTML document
to tell the browser where to find the CSS file used to style the page and this method called using external css.You can 
also include CSS rules within an HTML page by placing them inside a <style> element, which usually sits inside the 
<head> element of the page and this is called using external css . why uSe externaL StyLe SheetS? the answer is that  When building 
a website there are several advantages to placing your CSS rules in a separate style sheet.

CSS treats each HTML element as if it appears inside  X its own box and uses rules to indicate how that element should look.
Rules are made up of selectors (that specify the  X elements the rule applies to) and declarations (that indicate what
these elements should look like).Different types of selectors allow you to target your  X rules at different elements.
Declarations are made up of two parts: the properties  X of the element that you want to change, and the values of 
those properties. For example, the font-family property sets the choice of font, and the value arial specifies Arial
as the preferred typeface.CSS rules usually appear in a separate document,  X although they may appear within an HTML page.
