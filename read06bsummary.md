# How Computers Work:

## All computers do the same 4 things
* take input
* store in storage
* processing the data
* output the results

## Binary & Data
* computers work on ones & zeroes, but actually almost nobody deals directly with ones & zeros
* inside computers wires & circuits carry all the information in a computer

### Computers in the past was really large and slow, take hours just to do basic math problem !
### Computers in now days is really amazing, we can connect each other, play games, control robots and do any crazy thing you can imagine.

## 1 and 0 play a big rule (binary)
### Wires and Circuits carry all the informations inside computer
### computers storge texts, audios, imagines as numbers 1 and 0.

### Harderware (mouse , wires , spearker , keyboard...)
### Software programs and codes , we dont see like(Apps, Games, Maps...)

 # circuit and logic
### Binary information is represented in digital computers by physical quantities called signals.
### Electrical signals such as voltages exist throughout the computer in either one of the two recognizable states.
### The two states represent a binary variable that can be equal to 1 or 0.
